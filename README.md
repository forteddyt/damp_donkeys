# The Damp Donkeys

Welcome to The Damp Donkeys' interview check-in system. This is a semester long project for Virginia Tech's Software Engineering Capstone course (CS 4704).

## General Information

Check-in system is split across three main repository branches: `server`, `client`, and `database`.

Each branch is responsible for its associated portion of the system. Each branch should contain a README.md containing more information on that system's portion.

## Development Information

Switch to appropriate branch with `git checkout <branch_name>`

Additional branches should *never* branch from master, but instead from the appropriate system portion (ie. branch)
